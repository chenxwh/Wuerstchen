# Würstchen
![main-figure-github](https://github.com/dome272/wuerstchen/assets/61938694/cc811cfd-c603-4767-bdc7-4cd1539daa35)


## What is this?
Würstchen is a new framework for training text-conditional models by moving the computationally expensive text-conditional stage into a highly compressed latent space. Common approaches make use of a single stage compression, while Würstchen introduces another Stage that introduces even more compression. In total we have Stage A & B that are responsible for compressing images and Stage C that learns the text-conditional part in the low dimensional latent space. With that Würstchen achieves a 42x compression factor, while still reconstructing images faithfully. This enables training of Stage C to be fast and computationally cheap. We refer to [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00637) for details.

## Use Würstchen
You can use the model simply through the notebooks here. The [Stage B](https://github.com/dome272/wuerstchen/blob/main/w%C3%BCrstchen-stage-B.ipynb) notebook only for reconstruction and the [Stage C](https://github.com/dome272/wuerstchen/blob/main/w%C3%BCrstchen-stage-C.ipynb) notebook is for the text-conditional generation. You can also try the text-to-image generation on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UTP9Xn2UIrVbAXyL-SKEvyLmgVWdw-Vy?usp=sharing).

## Train your own Würstchen
Training Würstchen is considerably faster and cheaper than other text-to-image as it trains in a much smaller latent space of 12x12.
We provide training scripts for both [Stage B](https://github.com/dome272/wuerstchen/blob/main/train_stage_B.py) and [Stage C](https://github.com/dome272/wuerstchen/blob/main/train_stage_C.py).
